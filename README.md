# 🌐 Front-End Development

This repo tracks my work in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Projects include:
- Page structure and layout
- Responsive design
- JavaScript interactivity
- DOM manipulation and basic form handling

Some of these projects will be online challenges including work from The Odin Project.
